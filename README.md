Tikcket booking - End to End Scenario

For the scenario of booking ticket with wrong card details and getting declind error message to be printed.
I have created maven projet with junit frame work.
Tools: Selenium webdriver -version -2.53 ,pageobjectmodel
Language : Java.
browser : Firefox - 44.0.1

I have used 3 java class -1) Basic_methods.java
                          2) Raynair_Booking.java
                          3) webelements.java
                          
1)  Basic_methods.java class - These few methods which does basic actions like click(clicking an webelemnt) .sendkeys(writing text to the field)                       
    These methods can used over and over whenever it required while writing testcases.  
    
 2) raynair_Booking,java class  - This class actuallyhas testcases of booking ticket end-to end scenario and error message printed when card details are declined.
 
 3)webelemnts.java - This class has all webelemnts .
